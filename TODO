- weird bug where allocationst at the top end of memory are broken (NORMAL, not DEVICE)

- code cleanup needs to be done and lots of debug prints happen.

- Remove debug printing from tool invocation
  - Or at least print out multikernel info in a structured way, it might make sense
    to have some printing still since we are still experimenting.

- handle non-contiguous physical memory (e.g. for the odroid) in the tool's
  assignment of what memory to use for each core.

- "shared" memory that is passed to the kernel by the loader as device memory
  is not zeroed by the kernel, which means if it is reused in a more dynamic system
  then we get information leaks. at the moment the loader zeroes it out, which
  it might not be on system boot.

  maybe we need a third type that the kernel can zero?
