- need a way to ensure that only one kernel can modify GIC registers (for setting target IDs, basically)
  -> at the moment we just hardcode init_irqs() to only initialise only core 1...

- shared memory currently makes copy of all the buffers on every core 
  and so isn't shared
  only create the buffers necessary on each

- timer sddf example broken? null caps?

- zero out memory before using it
