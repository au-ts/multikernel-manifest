- need a way to ensure that only one kernel can modify GIC registers (for setting target IDs, basically)
  -> at the moment we just hardcode init_irqs() to only initialise only core 1...

- zero out memory before using it
  -> for cross-core memory that is device memory seL4 doesnt zero it out
  -> a lot of our sDDF examples do not zero memory, as they assume seL4 has zeroed it
  -> this breaks a lot of our queues.

- weird bug where allocationst at the top end of memory are broken (NORMAL, not DEVICE)

- need to make the size of the allocations not fixed

- code cleanup needs to be done and lots of debug prints happen.
